# The School Schedule Clock

Ever wondered, "How long until this period ends?"

The School Schedule Clock (SSC) is a feature-filled clock that makes keeping track of your school periods easy!

## How to use

SSC can be found online at [lraj22.github.io/ssc/][ssc]. Click the link to open it.

It's really easy to use:

1. Enter your schedule into the user-friendly schedule editor. **Hint**: This can include class periods, passing periods, lunch, etc. Whatever you need!
2. Save your schedule. **Optional**: Share the bookmarkable link or download it as a file.
3. SSC will automatically keep track of what class period (/passing period/lunch break/etc.) you're in and let you know how much time is left, along with how much time has passed!

## Features

- **Stopwatch.** Clean, minimalistic, and simple.
- **Timer.** Clean, minimalistic, simple, AND customizable! Choose your favorite timer-end ringing sound or mute it permanently in the settings.
- **Themes.** Mix and match the background and foreground colors.
- **Many more customizable settings!**

Note: All of the listed features work without needing a schedule to be entered first.
